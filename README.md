Title: "A Tale of Two Provers": A Comparison between Two Program Verification Techniques in Dependent Haskell and F*

Short Abstract: 

I demonstrate for the first time how effectful F* functions can be used in the proofs at type level. I implemented 
various algorithms in both Dependent Haskell and F*, and evaluated the proofs based on syntax and expressiveness, 
proof verification and termination checking. Finally, based on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two
provers, I proposed several suggestions to both communities for future research directions.
